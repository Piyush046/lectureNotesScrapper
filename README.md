# lectureNotesScrapper

Allows scrapping images from the website  http://lecturenotes.in

This website has enginnering, BCA, MCA etc notes 

#### _I genuinely feel that you should pay them/ use their platform for viewing/downloading notes; and add to their revenue._

But still, if you need some of it offline, you can have the images; just don't go crazy over it

# How to use the script?

must have python installed on system and then install following library if not present by entering the following command in cmd/ terminal:

  `pip install requests`

Just enter the id of the note found in url; after you run the script

for example: 
> https://lecturenotes.in/notes/82-notes-for-operating-systems-os-by-verified-writer
> 
> In the above url you have the notes id as 82

Script will create the folder named (82) with all the images; where you run the script
