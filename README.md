# lectureNotesScrapper

Allows scrapping images from the enginnering,bba,bca etc notes website  http://lecturenotes.in

I genuinely feel that you should pay them/ use their platform for viewing/downloading notes; and add to their revenue.

But still if you need some of it offline, you can have the images; just don't go crazy over it

# How to use the script

must have python installed on system
and install following libs if not present using 

  `pip install requests`

Just enter the id of the note found in url in the 5th line of script

for example: https://lecturenotes.in/notes/82-notes-for-operating-systems-os-by-verified-writer

the above url would have the notes id as 82

it will create the folder with this name (82); where you run the script
